# bandit

Consider  the  following  learning  problem.   You  are  faced  repeatedly  with  a choice among n different options, or actions.  After each choice you receive a numerical reward chosen from a stationary probability distribution that depends on the action you selected.  Your objective is to maximize the expected total reward over some time period, for example, over 1000 action selections,or time steps.This is the original form of the n-armed bandit problem, so named by analogy  to  a  slot  machine,  or  “one-armed  bandit,”  except  that  it  has n levers instead of one.
